Module 3 -- Mapping and Genome Rearrangement

LAB #2

OBJECTIVE:
Perform a breakpoint analysis to determine structural rearrangements in a mapped BAM file.

TOOLS USED:
We will use lumpy-sv (https://github.com/arq5x/lumpy-sv) to perform the structural rearrangement analysis
using the BAM file from step 1.

# Start of Exercise
###################

#
# Step 1. Prepare input for lumpy by making BAM files that only contain 
# discordant read pairs and split reads.

# First, make a BAM containing discordant pairs.
# Remember, discordant read pairs are those that do not map in the expected orientation
# or are too close/too far apart.

samtools view -b -F 1294 sample.sorted.bam > sample.discordants.bam

# Next, make a BAM containing split reads. Split reads are those that are mapped with a large gap.

samtools view -h sample.sorted.bam | ~/CourseData/CG_data/Module3/scripts/extractSplitReads_BwaMem -i stdin | samtools view -Sb - > sample.splitters.bam

# Step 2. Determine the distribution of paired-end fragment sizes. This tells lumpy how far apart paired-end reads should be
# and helps it determine where structural variants are. This code will print the mean and standard deviation
# of the fragment distribution to the screen.

cat sample.sam | tail -n+100000 | ~/CourseData/CG_data/Module3/scripts/pairend_distro.py -r 101 -X 4 -N 10000 -o sample.lib1.histo

#
# Step 3. Run lumpy. The following command is long so we break it into multiple lines by using the "\" symbol.
# You should still be able to copy-and-paste it into your terminal. 
#
# We are passing the discordant read BAM file in with the -pe flag,
# and the split read BAM file in with the -se flag.

# The output is in VCF format: https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf

cat sample.vcf

# Lumpy found about 260 SV events. The VCF file includes useful information about the variant calls.
# The SVTYPE attribute tells us the structural variation type. Most of the events are deletions (SVTYPE=DEL).
# The PE and SR tags in each line tell us how many paired-end and split-reads support each call. The calls with many
# supporting reads are usually more likely to be true structural variants.
#
# Let's filter the list of events by only looking at those that are supported by 15 reads:

~/CourseData/CG_data/Module3/scripts/filter-by-support --min-support 15 sample.vcf

# Only 44 events are supported by at least 15 reads. Let's now take a closer look in IGV.

#
# Step 4. Viewing rearrangements in IGV and classifying events
#

# If you do not have IGV open, follow the instructions in lab 1.

# Navigate to the genomic location 20:32,407,585-32,416,459
# This region contains a deletion that lumpy-sv found.
# Right-click on an alignment and select 'view as pairs'
# If you hover or click on one of the reads that is colored red
# you can view its insert size. You will notice many of the pairs
# have an insert size of around 3000bp. These 'stretched' pairs
# support the deletion. The coverage track in IGV shows
# the deleted region has lower coverage, which also supports the call.

# Navigate to 20:33,113,802-33,118,238 to view a second deletion.

# Navigate to the location 20:25,967,655-25,976,529
# This region also shows 'stretched' pairs but there is no drop in coverage.
# If you examine the orientation of the pairs you will notice that they are both
# on the same strand (+/+ or -/-). Remember, we expect the pairs to be on opposite
# strands (+/- or -/+). This means the event is probably an inversion.

# Did lumpy find this call? Lets search the output for an event around this location
# We'll use awk to find all events on chromosome 29, between position 25,900,000 and 26,000,000

cat sample.vcf | awk '$1 == 20 && $2 >= 25900000 && $2 < 26000000'

# Lumpy found 5 events in this region. 4 of them are small deletions supported by less than 10 paired-end reads
# and no split reads. Lumpy also found a large inversion supported by 78 paired-end reads. This is the event we saw in IGV.
# It was not supported by split reads but this is not unusual for inversions. The paired-end evidence is high so
# we have confidence this is a true inversion.

# View the event at 20:26,318,238-26,318,791
# This region is difficult. Notice that the coverage significantly
# increases in the region and there are many reads mapped with mismatches
# and low mapping quality.
# Many of the pairs of the reads map to different chromosomes. It is difficult
# to tell what is happening in this case.

# For the remainder of the lab view other events and try to determine if they are real.
