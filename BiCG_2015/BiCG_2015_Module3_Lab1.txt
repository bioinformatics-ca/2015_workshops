Module 3 -- Mapping and Genome Rearrangement

LAB #1

OBJECTIVE:

Map FASTQ files to the human reference genome and explore the tools available for working with alignments.

TOOLS USED:

We will be using:
* bwa (read mapper)
* samtools (utilities to view/modify alignment files)
* Picard  (utilities to view/modify alignment files)
* IGV (genome browser)

Instructions:

In the following exercise, lines starting with a # symbol are comments.
The lines without # symbols are the commands that you should run in the terminal.

# Start of Exercise
###################

#
# Step 0. Create a directory to store your working data
# Run the following commands by copying and pasting or typing them into the terminal:
#

cd ~/workspace
mkdir module3
cd module3

#
# Step 1. Map reads to the reference genome using bwa
# 

# bwa mem is the latest mapping algorithm in the bwa software package
# You can read about how it works here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3997
# This command may take a few minutes to run

bwa mem -t 4 ~/CourseData/CG_data/Module3/human_g1k_v37.fasta ~/CourseData/CG_data/Module3/reads_1.fastq ~/CourseData/CG_data/Module3/reads_2.fastq > sample.sam

# If this command is taking a long time, you can just copy the results to your working directory
# to proceed with the step 2 of the exercise:

cp ~/CourseData/CG_data/Module3/sample.sam .

#
# Step 2. Explore the alignment data
#

# SAM is a plain-text format that can be viewed from the command line
# Use the head command to look at your alignments.
# You will see the SAM header containing the reference information
# followed by a few alignments.

head -100 sample.sam

# In this SAM file, the reads are ordered by their position in the original FASTQ file.
# We usually want to order the alignments by their position on the reference genome.
# We will use Picard's SortSam tool to do this. The output will be in BAM format
# which takes up much less disk space than SAM.

java -jar /usr/local/picard/picard.jar SortSam I=sample.sam O=sample.sorted.bam SO=coordinate CREATE_INDEX=true

# The samtools view command can be used to convert BAM to SAM (and vice-versa)

samtools view sample.sorted.bam | head -100

# 'samtools view' can also extract the alignments for regions of the genome
# this command will give you all the alignments for a 10kb region of chromosome 20

samtools view sample.sorted.bam 20:26,000,000-26,010,000

# As a tab-delimited file, the SAM format is easy to manipulate with common
# unix tools like grep, awk, cut, sort. For example, this command
# uses cut to extract just the reference coordinates from the alignments

samtools view sample.sorted.bam 20:26,000,000-26,010,000 | cut -f3-4

# We can samtools flagstat command to get a summary of the alignments

samtools flagstat sample.sorted.bam

# We can use 'samtools idxstats' to count the number of reads mapped to each chromosome

samtools idxstats sample.sorted.bam

# This command will count the number of reads on chromosome 20

samtools idxstats sample.sorted.bam | awk '$1 == "20"'

#
# Step 3. Examining alignments
#

# You can view all of the aligned reads for a particular reference base using mpileup.
# The following command will show the read bases and their quality scores at a heterozygous SNP.
# The "." and "," symbols indicate bases that match the reference. 
# There are 18 reads that show a "G" base at this position. 
# The individual's genotype at this position is likely A/G.

samtools mpileup -f ~/CourseData/CG_data/Module3/human_g1k_v37.fasta -r 20:32,001,292-32,001,292 sample.sorted.bam

# Load the data into IGV by performing the following:
#   Open IGV and change the genome from hg19 to 'human_g1k_v37'
#   Choose 'Load from URL' from the file menu
#   Type: http://cbw#.entrydns.org/module3/sample.sorted.bam where # is your student ID
#   Navigate to 20:32,001,292
# Notice that the alignments have high mapping quality.

# Now we will view the alignments for a different position:

samtools mpileup -f ~/CourseData/CG_data/Module3/human_g1k_v37.fasta -r 20:25,997,273-25,997,273 sample.sorted.bam

# In this case, 11 reads show a T base at this position.
# Look at the alignments in IGV by navigating to 20:25,997,273. 
# The reads colored white have mapping quality 0.
# This means the alignment is ambiguous and should not be trusted.
# It is unclear whether the T->C alignments are true SNPs.

# This is the end of lab 1. You can use the remaining time to explore the alignments
# and ask questions if you notice anything unusual or interesting.
