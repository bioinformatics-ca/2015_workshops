Lab Module 5 - Software Installation Instructions
=================================================

This page describes where to get and how to install the software used for this lab module.

Installing Array Normalization Packages
---------------------------------------

We will use the procedure described on the [penncnv site](http://www.openbioinformatics.org/penncnv/penncnv_tutorial_affy_gw6.html). This page also contains links to most of the software we need to download.

> Note: You will need to register with Affymetrix to download the library files, specifically the .cdf file, from the [affimetrix site](http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=genomewidesnp_6). The [aroma-project](http://www.aroma-project.org/docs) has a copy available which we will download since it can be done from the cloud.

    wget http://www.openbioinformatics.org/penncnv/download/penncnv.latest.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf penncnv.latest.tar.gz

    wget http://www.openbioinformatics.org/penncnv/download/gw6.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf gw6.tar.gz
        
    wget http://media.affymetrix.com/Download/updates/apt-1.17.0-x86_64-intel-linux.zip
    unzip apt-1.17.0-x86_64-intel-linux.zip
        
    wget http://www.aroma-project.org/data/annotationData/chipTypes/GenomeWideSNP_6/GenomeWideSNP_6.cdf.gz
    gunzip GenomeWideSNP_6.cdf.gz

Installing OncoSNP
------------------

For predicting CNVs from the array data we will use OncoSNP in this lab. The files for OncoSNP can be downloaded from <https://sites.google.com/site/oncosnp/user-guide/downloads>. Before you can use OncoSNP, you will need to register with the author and he will supply a password which you can use to unlock the downloaded files.

Here we will download OncoSNP version 1.4:

    wget http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~cyau/oncosnp/oncosnp_v1.4.run
    bash oncosnp_v1.4.run          # enter your oncosnp password

Then follow the on-screen instructions.

You'll also need to get the matching MATLAB MCR file to be used with OncoSNP. This will be described on the website.

    wget ftp://ftp.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/yau/oncosnp/mcr/MCRinstaller.run.zip
    unzip MCRinstaller.run.zip
    bash MCRinstaller.run          # enter your oncosnp password, and select installation directory

The `MCRinstaller.run` installer will ask you where to install the MATLAB MCR files. You should `export` `MCR_DIR=` to create an environment variable pointing to the location to which you installed MATLAB MCR. The MCR will be located in a subdirectory `MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/vXXX` for version XXX of the compiler.

We will also need to download GC content files for the relevant build of the genome. For this tutorial we will use the hg19 (build 37) files.

    wget ftp://ftp.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/yau/quantisnp2/download/b36.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf b36.tar.gz
    export GC_DIR=$INSTALL_DIR/b36

Installing HMMCopy
------------------

For this tutorial we will install HMMCopy. It is a Bioconductor package <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/HMMcopy.html>.

We will start R.

    R

and inside the R environment execute

    source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
    biocLite("HMMcopy")

where the last line was copied from the HMMcopy Bioconductor page. Follow along and accept any suggested updates.

HMMcopy also has C package associated with it. We will need to download this from <http://compbio.bccrc.ca/software/hmmcopy>.

    cd $INSTALL_DIR/src
    wget http://compbio-bccrc.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2013/12/HMMcopy.zip
    unzip http://compbio-bccrc.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2013/12/HMMcopy.zip
    cd HMMcopy_0.1.1_14Dec2012
    make

Installing TITAN
----------------

TITAN is available as a Bioconductor R package. We can install it in R. First open R:

    R

In R, enter the following commands:

    source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
    biocLite("TitanCNA")
