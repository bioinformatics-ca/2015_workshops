# Environment and user interface
# ==================================================

# Set up your workspace
# =====================

# Let's set the current "working directory" to your CBW
# workshop directory. You have a workshop directory, right?

# where are you now?
getwd()


# syntax to set the working directory...
setwd("/path/of/your/directory") # the argument is a string
setwd("/path/of/your/course\ directory") # "escape" blank spaces
list.files()

# A note for Windows: the "\" (backslash) has a particular
# meaning in strings: it "escapes" the following character.
# Therefore something like setwd("C:\My\R\files\") will NOT
# work. You have to "escape the escape character" to turn it
# into a "literal" backslash: setwd("C:\\My\\R\\files\\") or
# R will translate for you: setwd("C:/My/R/files/")

# I usually write setwd("whatever/path") as the first command
# in my scripts. More on that when we start writing programs.

# But how do you know what the full path for the working
# directory is?

# There is a neat trick to get the path for a file (on the Mac).
# Drag and drop a file into a script. This will put the full path
# of the file into your script (... as the argument to a source()
# command). Does this work on Windows?
# Linux?

# Try this.
# But unfortunately this does not work in R-Studio. There, you can
# use the menu. Then copy the command into your script.



# ==================================================
# Using scripts.
# ==================================================

# All your R work should always go into a script.


# Put the cursor in any line, or select a block of code
# then press
#    <command><return> (Mac)
#    <ctrl><r> (Win)
# to execute it in the console.

# Try:

length(dir("~", pattern = ".txt"))


# In the console, use <up-arrow>, <left-arrow> etc. to
# retrieve and edit previous commands.

# You can use source("filename") to execute an entire
# script at once.


# ==================================================
# Help, documentation other information
# ==================================================

# Recapitulate ...
?dir    # help("dir")
??dir   # same as help.search("dir")

apropos("^dir")

# the "sos" package to look for functions everywhere
if (!require(sos, quietly=TRUE)) {
  install.packages("sos")
  library(sos)
}

ls("package:sos")         # contents of "sos"
browseVignettes("sos")    # documentation

# use "sos" to find more functions...
findFn("directory")       




# ==================================================
# Getting data into R
# ==================================================

# Assigning variables

x <- "1"
x
phi <- 2 * pi
phi
x <- pi
# Question: how many significant digits does R process?
# How do you print them all?

# Task: find out how to control the number of digits
#       printed in a print() expression.

# sprintf() gives the most control
sprintf("%50.49f", pi)

# Digression: Anatomy of a function ...


# Various functions exist to display the properties of R objects. Here
# is a function that combines them:

typeInfo <- function(x) {
    print(x, digits=22)  
    cat("str:    ")                
    str(x)  
    cat("mode:   ", mode(x), "\n")
    cat("typeof: ", typeof(x), "\n")
    cat("class:  ", class(x), "\n")
    # if there are attributes, print them too
    if (! is.null(attributes(x))) {
        cat("attributes:\n")
        print(attributes(x))
    }
}

# That's a useful utility to have. Let's take it apart.
# Now: where do we put it?



# Creating vectors

# Recapitulate:
v <- c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
v
v <- c(v, 13, 25)
v

1:3
seq(-0.5, 0.5, by = 0.1)
rep("Ha", 3)

genes <- c("Spic", "Cebpb", "Lyz2", "Sfpi1", "Nfkbiz")
# These are some of the genes that are markers for
# monocytes...

# Often our data can be copied and pasted: open the text file
# for "Fig_3-CharacteristicGenes".
# http://bioinformatics.ca/workshop_wiki/images/b/b8/Fig_3-CharacteristicGenes.txt

# Task: how do we get this data into a vector?
#       First think of a way to do this by hand.
#       Then, design a function that would 
#       do this conveniently.


# Task:
# Consolidate working with text: convert a binomial
# scientific name into a 5-letter label.








# Glueing vectors together to make matrices:

# Task: make a vector with cell-types, according to Fig. 3,
#       use rep() expressions, don't type out every line.


# Task: Make a matrix from the gene names, so that each
# row contains the cell type and a characterisitc gene.


# Task: use cbind() to assemble the two vectors into one matrix.




# Lists



# ===================================================
# Data frames
# ===================================================

# A data frame is a matrix or a "set" of data. It is
# a list of vectors and/or factors of the same length,
# that are related "across", such that data in the
# same position come from the same experimental unit
# (subject, animal, etc).

# Importantly, the columns can have different type!

myDF <- data.frame(genes = c("Abc1", "Qrz", "Fubr31"),
                   expr = c(168059, 23490578, 34),
                   induced = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))
myDF[-2,]
typeInfo(myDF)

# What is it with the factors? ...



myDF <- data.frame(genes = c("Abc1", "Qrz", "Fubr31"),
                   expr = c(168059, 23490578, 34),
                   induced = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
typeInfo(myDF)



# Why do we need data frames if they do the much 
# the same as a list?
# More efficient storage, and indexing! 
# R's read...() functions return data frames.

# ... which gets us back to our task of looking at expression
# values.


# The relevant data is in supplementary table 3 which is 
# an Excel spreadsheet.

# Download it from the workshop Wiki:



# A word on Excel: it's a very good spreadsheet program,
# it is miserable and often wrong on statistics,
# and it makes horrible, horrible plots.

# To elaborate - see the two links below:
# http://www.practicalstats.com/xlsstats/excelstats.html
# http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/spreadsheet-addiction/
# ... these are not merely cosmetic problems!

# Therefore: Ok to keep data in Excel spreadsheets
# if you must - but read it into R for any analysis!

# But be cautious: one of the problems of Excel is that
# it truncates numeric precision. Protip: convert all
# cells to "text" before export.

# There are many other "read" functions.
# Refer to the R Data Import / Export manual
# http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-data.html
# See:
?read.table # ... includes read.csv and read.delim
?read.fwf   # ... for "fixed width format"
?readLines  # ... for reading in text-files line by line

# Excel spreadsheets should be converted to csv
# or tsv format. Alternatively the package
# xlsreadwrite is available via CRAN ... see
# http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xlsReadWrite/
# ... but I think this is unsound practice.

# Task:
# 1 - load the data in Table_S3.xls on the Wiki 
#     into Excel, and save it as
#     a .csv (comma separated values) file.
# 2 - Examine the file (a plain text file) in a 
#     text-editor (such as R). 
# 3 - Read the table into R, assigning it to a variable.
#     I usually give the first input of data the variable
#     name "rawDat" since it will usually be processed before
#     it becomes meaningful for analysis.
# 4 - Use head() to look at the beginning of the object.
# 5 - Remove any unneeded header rows.
# 6 - Give the columns names that reflect the cell type (cf. 
#     Figure 2c), and the stimulus status.
# 7 - Use typeInfo() to analyse the object you have created.

# Much output. For a heavy-duty function, we should rewrite
# type info to limit the output ...

# Now: what is it with the "factors".

# ==================================================
# Digression: Factors...
# ==================================================

# Many of R's dataframe methods convert all strings
# into factors by default. Factors are special types:
# they are nominally strings - (m, f) or (agree, neutral,
# disagree) or such. But underlyingly they are coded as integers
# that identify the "levels" of the factor.

# To illustrate.
genders <- factor(c("m", "f", "f", "m", "f"))
genders
typeInfo(genders)
is.ordered(genders)

# We can define ordered factors by adding some details to
# our factor() command - e.g. tumor grades:


sampleGrades <- factor(c("G1", "G3", "G3", "G1", "G2", "G1"),
                       levels = c("G1", "G2", "G3", "G4"),
                       ordered = TRUE)
sampleGrades   # Note that G4 is a level although it
               # was not observed in the data
is.ordered(sampleGrades)       

# Factors are useful since they support a number of analysis
# methods such as ordering boxplots, or calculating 

# For more on factors, have a look at this factor tutorial
# by Jenny Bryan: 
# http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block08_bossYourFactors.html
# and this discussion on their use:
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3445316/factors-in-r-more-than-an-annoyance
# 

# But for our purposes, the default behavior of R, to 
# treat all strings as factors is entirely unwanted
# and needs to be turned off. Always use the parameter
# stringsAsFactors = FALSE to achieve this. If you don't
# you are in for some bad surprises if e.g. there is
# a character "contaminant" in a numeric column.

myDF <- data.frame(data = c("N/A", 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8))
typeInfo(myDF)
myDF <- myDF[-1, ]
myDF

myDF2 <- as.numeric(myDF)
myDF2     # Whoa! what just happened ?

myDF3 <- as.numeric(as.character(myDF))
myDF3     # :-)


# Task:
# Repair the sup3 data.frame - realod it with
# stringsAsFactors = FALSE


sup3[1:10,]
head(sup3)
tail(sup3)
nrow(sup3)
ncol(sup3)
sup3$genes[1:10]
sup3$genes[1:10]




# Now we can finally return to our original question and try
# e.g ...

sup3[sup3$genes == "Cd19", ]
sup3[sup3$genes == "Lyz2", ]

# But!
sup3[sup3$genes == "B220", ]   # Not found!

# B220 has a number of synonyms as a quick Google search shows:
B220
CD45
CD45R
GP180
L-CA
LCA
LY5
PTPRC
T200

# Is there a convenient way to convert such lines into
# a character vector?
# Yes: as we have done above, define the list as one string constant, then use
# strsplit() on it.

s <- "B220
CD45
CD45R
GP180
L-CA
LCA
LY5
PTPRC
T200"
B220synonyms <- unlist(strsplit(s, "\n"))

?"%in%"
B220synonyms %in% toupper(sup3$genes)

# However - no luck. None of the synonyms is in the table either.
# How do we know that this is not a problem with our expression?

# Positive control!
c(B220synonyms, "CD19") %in% toupper(sup3$genes)

# Task: check if our "characteristic genes" are all in the table
# then find the enrichment vectors for the subset
# Bst2, Siglech, Ly6d, Irf8


# To do more than that, we really need to look at writing
# "programs".
