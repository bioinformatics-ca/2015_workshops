1) The default p-value is 0.01. This can be determined by looking at the help dialogue of the PEAR command, `pear -h`.

2) UPARSE found approximately 3342 chimeras (6.9% of the unique sequences). 93.2% of the sequences mapped onto the OTUs, leaving 6.8% of 1,032,912 sequences, or 70,238 sequences, discarded. 2,467 OTUs were discovered. NOTE: These numbers may vary slightly from run to run.

3) Datasets: SILVA, CORE Oral, Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD), NCBI's 16S dataset, or PhytoREF for plastidial rRNA genes. There are many additional datasets for other marker genes (18S, ITS, mitochondrial genes, etc.) Other classification methods include BLAST, rtax, utax, and "16S Classifier". Some reference datasets may be better for specialized environments (such as CORE or HOMD for human oral samples). Every dataset has different requirements before a sequence is included, so be sure to investigate how the reads in your dataset were annotated. Also check the release date for the reference dataset you want to use. GreenGenes, for example, has not been updated since August 2013. You may wish to choose a more frequently updated dataset, like SILVA (last updated April 2015). If you have an organism or group of interest, it is important to check that the organism is well represented in your reference set.

4) Sequence alignment was done by PyNAST, which is a template-based method. FastTree is used to create the phylogenetic tree. With the command `FastTree -expert`, you can see that the version used is FastTree 2.1.3 SSE3. This version was released in April 2010. The current version is 2.1.8, released March 2015. Since it often takes developers of pipelines a significant amount of time to update to the most recent version of software tools, it is sometimes prudent to learn to use a tool independent of the pipeline software. This ensures that your results are not needlessly affected by bugs that have already been fixed.

5) The tab-separated format is human readable. In particular, it can be opened and explored in Excel (if the file is small enough) or with programs like `awk` or `grep`. Some programs may not be compatible with the BIOM format, but may be compatible with the simpler format instead.

6) Rarefaction will "throw out" data from samples that have a higher sampling depth than the minimum. If some samples are sequenced to a significantly higher depth, there can be a lot of variation in these samples between independent rarefactions. Often a "jackknifing" procedure is done where the rarefaction is performed many times, allowing a confidence interval to be produced for each sample. Alternatives include variance stabilizing transformations, such as those available in the R DESeq2 and Metagenomeseq packages. A QIIME wrapper script, normalize_table.py, makes using these packages easier (see http://qiime.org/scripts/normalize_table.html).

7) Approximately 31% of the variance was captured by the primary axis, and 14% by the secondary axis, for a total of 45% on a 2D plot. Latitude may be a significant factor affecting the Bray-Curtis distance between points. The ARCT (Arctic) samples also seem to group together, but some NWCS (North West Continental Shelf) samples are similar to the Arctic samples.

8) We can open the tab-separated (.tab) OTU tables and search them with a text editor or Excel. Alternatively, we could run `grep Sediminicola otu_table/otu_table.tab` to get the OTU number (the value in the first column). Next, we can grab the sequence from the representative sequence file (rep_set.fa) with `grep -A 4 '>x$' cluster/rep_set.fasta` where x is replaced by the OTU number found previously. Aligning this sequence against NCBI's database with BLAST shows hits to ''Flavobacteria'' at 99% identity, but not ''Sediminicola''. It is possible that these unclassified ''Flavobacteria'' sequences are ''Sediminicola'', but it would be healthy to be suspicious of this classification.
